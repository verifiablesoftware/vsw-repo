## About the project

VSW Repo is server part of the project. Client part can be be found in a separate git repo. For details about the verifiable software ecosystem, see [vsw](https://github.com/verifiablesoftware/vsw) which contains the `vsw` command line tool for client useage. This VSW Repo is intended to to be used as VSW server. Internal structure of the Node.js based repo server can been seen in the image below.

## Run vsw repo locally

provision the aca-py agent and create wallet. The wallet has to be created first any case by using provision parameters for Aca-py.

```
./repo-provision-local.sh
```

when running this, user will be prompted
``` 
Created new wallet
Wallet type: indy
Wallet name: Repo.Local
Created new public DID: G5ZDvU1Y7hTKnQR6xXXXX
Verkey: 9DfRgQevqRE2HAC9n4T7whfLBet8yTa6jUWzXZXXXXXX

----

Please select an option:
 1. Accept the transaction author agreement and store the acceptance in the wallet
 2. Acceptance of the transaction author agreement is on file in my organization
 X. Skip the transaction author agreement   
 ```
 and before accepting, register DID and Verkey to [sovrin buildernet](https://selfserve.sovrin.org/) 


After provisioning, start the aca-py agent 
```
./repo-start-local.sh
```
this script starts node server with [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)

or for Visual Studio Code debugging [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
, there is ```Run vsw-repo locally start``` launch.json that launches local vsw-repo debugging.

## Run inside the docker

build docker image(s) (requires wallet to start the vsw-repo) 

for vsw-repo

```
./repo-local-build.sh
```

or

```
docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t vsw-repo .
```

## run vsw-repo container with docker
and for example use the ports 8040-8042 for repo, repo api and repo controller
```
docker run -d --name vsw-repo -p 8060:8040 -p 8061:8041 -p 8062:8042  vsw-repo
```

## AWS

details about AWS can be found [AWS](/AWS_README.md)
when vsw-repo is running in the AWS cloud EC2 URL is something like this:

http://ec2-3-XXX-XXX-46.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8060

this has to be given to docker image when starting the vsw-repo docker image

## publish to AWS

a separate AWS_README.md is available for how this image can be build, pushed to private registry and 
run in AWS EC2.
